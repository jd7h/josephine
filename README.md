# josephine
Book catalogue system in Python/Django.

## Etymology
josephine is named after Jo March, my favorite bookworm, from the novel Little Women by Louisa Alcott. 

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by GoodReads (owned by Amazon, not self-hosted), LibraryThing (not intuitive, not self-hosted), and https://books.hansdezwart.nl (PHP, not opensource).
